#
# This sets a delay between data bursts that dc-tool sends to the Dreamcast.
# dcload-ip configures the Dreamcast BBA to use a 16kB receive buffer, while the
# LAN adapter has a 28kB buffer. So after a number of packets determined by
# BBA_RX_FIFO_DELAY_COUNT or LAN_RX_FIFO_DELAY_COUNT, dc-tool gives the Dreamcast
# a chance to empty its buffer.
#
# Decreasing TIME may increase network throughput performance, as it will
# shorten the delay time. However, making it too low will cause packets to be
# dropped by the Dreamcast. If dcload-ip says "link change" during receipt of
# dc-tool-ip data, that means the number is too low and a FIFO overflow occurred.
# Either cancel dc-tool-ip (ctrl + c) and try again, or increase the number in
# this case. ...At least, the link change message is true of the BBA. The LAN
# adapter has tendency to just hang and cut out, necessitating a reset of the
# console (and an increase in this number!). Note that seeing "idle" flash after
# an overrun link change means dropped packets are being re-sent. If this happens,
# network transfer performance will be significantly slower than in the "receiving
# data" state, and cancelling and retrying the transfer is recommended.
#
# NOTE: This value has no effect on dcload -> dc-tool data, which will always run
# as fast as possible (I've gotten 10MB/s with the BBA). Only dc-tool -> dcload
# data is affected by this. It's mainly to account for PCs having gigabit ethernet
# and the internal processing paths of dcload only being able to handle about 10MB/s
# (100mbit/s maxes at 12.5MB/s).
#
# Also, dcload-ip v2.0.0 takes 30000 SH4 cycles, or 0.00015 seconds (= 150
# microseconds), to process 1 packet of 1494 (1440 + headers) bytes destined for
# an 8-byte-aligned address. That *should* be able to sustain dc-tool -> dcload
# data at ~9.5MB/s, but I haven't been able to hit that. The most I could squeeze
# between overrun errors was 6.0MB/s with COUNT = 10, TIME = 1350.
#
# Some helpful guidelines, tested with a 15.6MB program:
# BBA:
#   max (ideal conditions, 5.5MB/s):
#     COUNT = 10
#     TIME = 1500
#   safe (4.3-4.6MB/s):
#     COUNT = 10
#     TIME = 2000
# LAN:
#   max (ideal conditions, 1.1MB/s):
#     COUNT = 1
#     TIME = 1200
#   safe (710KB/s-1.0MB/s):
#     COUNT = 1
#     TIME = 1250
#
# Note that dcload-ip v2.0.0+ packets are 1494 bytes per packet, unless -l is
# used to make them 1078 bytes.
#
# COUNT - Number of packets to send before waiting for DC to empty its RX FIFO
# TIME - How long to wait for DC to empty its RX FIFO, in microseconds
